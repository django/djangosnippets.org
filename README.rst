djangosnippets.org
==================

This code is used to power the snippet sharing site, `djangosnippets.org`_

Database Setup Using Windows
-----------------------------------

Download the latest version of PostgreSQL_. Click on the executable to start the installation setup wizard.

Click ``Next``, keeping all the defaults as you work through the wizard. Make a note
of the password you choose for the database superuser (postgres). Select the default port 5432 and the default
locale. After itâ€™s finished installing, you do not need to launch Stack Builder. Un-tick that box if you are asked,
and click ``Finish``.

Open SQL Shell (psql). In the shell, select the default values for Server, Database, Port and Username
(basically, press Enter four times).

Type in the password you noted earlier and press enter. Run the command below, taking care to include the
semi-colon. ::

    $ CREATE DATABASE djangosnippets;

Close SQL Shell (psql).

You need to copy .env.example to env.bat and configure to your needs. Use the template below, taking care to
include ``set`` at the start of each line, and to substitute the password you noted earlier into DATABASE_URL.
For development, DEBUG is set to True. ::

    set REDISTOGO_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
    set SECRET_KEY=p_o3vp1rg5)t^lxm9-43%0)s-=1qpeq%o7gfq+e4#*!t+_ev82
    set DEBUG=True
    set ALLOWED_HOSTS=0.0.0.0,127.0.0.1
    set DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:your_password@:5432/djangosnippets
    set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=djangosnippets.settings.development
    set SEARCHBOX_SSL_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200/
    set SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False

Go back to your terminal. You will need to run the command below whenever you open a new terminal. ::

    $ env.bat

Your environment variables are now set and you can proceed with the instructions below.

Development Setup
-----------------

In a Python 3.7 virtual environment::

    $ cd requirements
    $ pip install -r development.txt
    $ cd ..
    $ python manage.py migrate

Now you can start the development server::

    $ python manage.py runserver

Before you can actually use the site, you have to define at least one
language. If you just want to use the ones from djangosnippets.org, they
are included in the fixtures folder. Also included are five snippets to get you started::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser
    $ python manage.py loaddata fixtures/cab.json

You will need to build the site.css with tailwindcss::

    $ npm run build

Now you should be able to use the development version of djangosnippets
on port 8000.

To run tests::

    $ python manage.py test --settings=djangosnippets.settings.testing

Docker
------
You need to copy .env.example to .env and configure to your needs. The example is fine to start with development.

You may wish to use docker locally for production dependency testing and development; here are the setup instructions::

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

-d denotes running docker in a detached state::

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml run web python manage.py migrate
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml run web python manage.py createsuperuser
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml run web python manage.py loaddata fixtures/cab.json
    $ npm run build
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml run web python manage.py collectstatic


The docker setup is running as close as possible to the production setup in Heroku:

Postgres 12.3
Gunicorn
Redis

To run our tests with docker::

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml run web python manage.py test --settings=djangosnippets.settings.testing

Styling Contributor?
--------------------

DjangoSnippets uses the Foundation_ framework as the core of its visual style. To
get this working on your local machine you need compass_ and bower_ to compile
your stylesheets. Please **never** modify the generated .css files directly. Use the .scss ones instead.

To keep the setup path as short as possible, run the following commands
in your terminal::

    $ cd djangosnippets/static
    $ bower install && compass watch

If you don't have either of these two installed, you can find detailed
instructions on their respective websites.

Please make sure that you commit only a compressed version of the CSS file
as this is what will be deployed. (In order to do that the default
configuration inside `djangosnippets/static/config.rb` is
`output_style = :compressed`)


Production Setup
----------------

The production setup is currently tailored to Heroku and, therefore, mostly
automatic. The difference between these two setups is configured in
the `djangosnippets.settings.production <./djangosnippets/settings/production.py>`_ module and the `requirements.txt <./requirements.txt>`_ file.
